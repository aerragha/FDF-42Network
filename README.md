# FDF-42Network
1st project of the Graphic Branch of 42. FDF is a 42 Project to learn about 3d programming. The program takes a map as parameter and creates its 3d representation.

You will also discover your first graphic library: miniLibX. This library was developed internally and includes the minimum necessary to open a window, light a pixel and deal with events linked to this window: keyboard and mouse. This project introduces you to “events” programming.
